										<p class="textStyle textStyleTemp">Our company started small in 2010, when the Baral family developed their first organic herb farming and distillation operation. At the time, Sandeep Baral had already discovered the incredible power of essential oils, but because the quality of available oils varied so greatly, he’d been unable to fully harness their potential. Baral family’s previous experience in the direct-selling industry enabled them to fulfill their vision and establish a business that would empower its members to share truly pure essential oils with the world. </p>
										<p class="textStyle textStyleTemp">After establishing Everest Aroma in 2010, they developed more farmland in  Kanchanpur and Bardiya, Nawalparasi  and began cultivating Cintronella, Lemongrass, Chamomile, Eucalyptus, and many other herbs. Fueled by a growing demand for top-quality essential oils, Everest Aroma designed and built the technologically advanced essential oil distillery in Nepal.

										<p class="textStyle textStyleTemp"> In harmony with these efforts, Everest Aroma developed the community by introducing them to MAPs farming, uplifting their standards. Through Sandeep Baral’s leadership, Everest Aroma has grown to become the world leader in essential oils. Based in Nepal, with offices and farms in various parts of the country, Everest Aroma stays true to Baral’s original vision. With our steadfast commitment to essential oil purity, we’ve inspired people everywhere to experience nature's gifts of wellness, as well as helping socially and economically marginalized communities, and to discover new opportunities for lifelong transformations.
