                            <p class="aboutCompany"> <div class="contentFont"> In this company we manufacture essential oils made from wild and organically 
                                grown spices and herbs. We cultivate these herbs in Chisapani community forest at Nawalparasi, Nepal 
                                following the EU and USDA standards. These herbs are grown and gathered with the greatest care maintaining
                                the biodiversity of the ecosystem throughout the process. Our qualified harvesters collect herbs from
                                different collection centers we have set up all over Nepal. Furthermore, state of the art technology is
                                used in all our field distillation units in Sindhupalchowk and Rammechhap and steam distillation units in 
                                Chispani. All this is carried out in low heat and pressure to ensure the superior quality of our product. 
                                The distilled product is then tested and packaged fittingly maintaining the essence of the oils which we 
                                distribute within the country and also to the international markets including Europe and the United States.</div></p>

                            <p class="aboutCompany"> <div class="contentFont"> Our company started small in 2010, when the Baral family developed their first organic herb farming and distillation operation. At the time, Sandeep Baral had already discovered the incredible power of essential oils, but because the quality of available oils varied so greatly, heâ€™d been unable to fully harness their potential. Baral familyâ€™s previous experience in the direct-selling industry enabled them to fulfill their vision and establish a business that would empower its members to share truly pure essential oils with the world. </div>
                            </p>

                            <p class="aboutCompany"> <div class="contentFont"> After establishing Everest Aroma in 2010, they developed more farmland in Kanchanpur and Bardiya, Nawalparasi and began cultivating Cintronella, Lemongrass, Chamomile, Eucalyptus, and many other herbs. Fueled by a growing demand for top-quality essential oils, Everest Aroma designed and built the technologically advanced essential oil distillery in Nepal.  </div>
                            </p>

                            <p class="aboutCompany"> <div class="contentFont"> In harmony with these efforts, Everest Aroma developed the community by introducing them to MAPs farming, uplifting their standards. Through Sandeep Baralâ€™s leadership, Everest Aroma has grown to become the world leader in essential oils. Based in Nepal, with offices and farms in various parts of the country, Everest Aroma stays true to Baralâ€™s original vision. With our steadfast commitment to essential oil purity, weâ€™ve inspired people everywhere to experience nature's gifts of wellness, as well as helping socially and economically marginalized communities, and to discover new opportunities for lifelong transformations.</div>
